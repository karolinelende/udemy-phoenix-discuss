# Phoenix v1.6.6 Web Application: Discuss

## Introduction
This repository contains a web application built in Phoenix called "Discuss". It is based on the Udemy course [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/). 

The course explains how to build the Discuss application using Phoenix v1.2, whereas in this repository I have built the application using Phoenix v1.6.6. The aim of sharing my code here is to provide support to others who wish to follow the video course using a newer version of Phoenix. 

## To run the application
1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the instructions in Video 98 to set up your GitHub OAuth app, and add your client ID and secret ID to the file `config/config.exs`.
3. To start your Phoenix server:
    * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
    * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
    * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
4. Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
